1. Product bug fixed. New empty group was created. Need to assign found in db group.
2. Ordering of products adjusted.
3. Bug with empty group name on Details and DetailsReadOnly fixed. Streight load from db added.
4. Bug with badges (product count) in groups fixed. ProductCount property added and init in Index method.
Thus it's even better.
